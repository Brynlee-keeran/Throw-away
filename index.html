    <h2>Application Overview:</h2>
      <p>Students and parents are able to view the session available for 
        sign-ups, what classes, times, and price amount. Able to book with button that takes you
        to Facebook messenger (our main booking way as of now).</p>
    <h2>Technology Overview:</h2>
      <p>I used Javacript for the engaging features and CSS to make it all look appealing.</p>

      <p>5/12/2025</p>
    <h2>Feature List:</h2>
      <p>Colorful and appealing CSS, help button, description button, drop-down buttons for info.,
         advanced "last updated" section, monthly and weekly looks into schedule.</p>
    <h2>Future Featere List</h2>
      <p>Dark mode, private lesson time slots, slots to reserve a spot for pre-registered kids with
         name and ID number.</p>
    <h2>Basic Technical Features:</h2>
      <p>CSS using the style tags to make the website look good to the eye.</p>
      <p>Using the toggle JavaScript to show and hide the price of each class.</p>
      <p>Using the div tag to put words and stuff exactly where I want them.</p>
      <p>The if/else statements check which section the user wants to view and display the 
        appropriate content.</p>
      <p>Using the href to take the user to the place quicker for booking.</p>
    <h2>Advanced Technical Features:</h2>
      <p>I got my "Book Now" buttons to pulse in order to pursuade more people to sign up.</p>
      <p>My "last updated" at the bottom auto-updates itself.</p>
      <p>Using a little bit more upgraded meta, my website will adjust better to different 
        sized electronics.</p>
